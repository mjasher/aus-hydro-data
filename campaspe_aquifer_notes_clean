Geology
===================================
There are several major geological features:
* Coliban basalt, Quaternary basalt, 34m thick, 0-63m down
	- south of catchment
	- steady head
	- fractured
	- south of catchment
* Shepparton Formation, Upper Tertiary/Quaternary Aquifer (UTQA), avg 35m thick, 0-63m down
	- Hydraulic conductivities 0.5 to 8 m/day [CSIRO]
	- specific yields 0.01 to 0.02 [CSIRO]
	- IGWWaterTableHydraulicConductivity [BOM Geofabric] suggests higher water table values of 0.01-0.2 for specific yields and 0.1 to 50 for hydraulic conductivity
	- salinity less than 1,000 mg/L TDS near the Campaspe River; 3,000 mg/L TDS near Rochester River; and greater than 13,000 mg/L TDS elsewhere
	- drawdowns
	- recharged via rainfall, river, irrigation (over 100 mm/year in intensively developed areas such as the Campaspe Irrigation District and the Rochester Irrigation Area)
	- highly variable (hence so is Campaspe river leakage)
	- sands, more clay north of [probably WARANGA WESTERN] chanel
* Calivil Formation, Upper Tertiary Aquifer - Fluvial (UTAF), avg 22m thick, 63-85m down
	- part of Deep Lead
* Renmark Group, Lower Tertiary Aquifer (LTA), avg 136m thick, 85-122m down
	- part of Deep Lead
* Deep Lead
	- hydraulic conductivities up to 100 m/day in the south and 185 m/day in the north
	- commences near Axedale and becomes progressively deeper to the north
	- salinity is higher in the north than the south and tends to vary between 600 and 4200 mg/L TDS
	- fluctuate head (by 20m) in response to seasonal pumping
	- steady drawdown has been observed since the mid-1990s
	- average of 15,557 ML of groundwater used per year (23,000 and 30,000 ML/year in the Campaspe Deep Lead WSPA)
* Basement or bedrock, 298m thick, 122-322m down
